# SECenterDeath
King of the Hill [SEServerExtender](https://github.com/SEServerExtender/SEServerExtender) Plugin for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/)

Factions fight over control of the center of the map and rewarded with points for capturing the center :smiling_imp:

**Motivation:**  
Space Engineers is missing a good game mode for online PVP (Player vs Player) players  
Currently most players:  
1. join a server  
2. hermit for a month  
3. server resets  
4. rinse, repeat  
Nobody ever runs into each other, this game mode gives players a purpose, something to fight over!
