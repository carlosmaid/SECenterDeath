# SECenterDeath
King of the Hill [SEServerExtender](https://github.com/SEServerExtender/SEServerExtender) Plugin for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/)

Players and Factions fight over control of the center of the map, 
rewarded with points for each successfull capture :smiling_imp:

Motivation:
Space Engineers is missing a good game mode for online PVP players,
Currently most players join servers, hermit for a month, and  no one runs into each other 
and then the server resets, rinse, repeat
This game mode will give them purpose, something to fight over!
