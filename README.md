# SECenterDeath
King of the Hill [SEServerExtender](https://github.com/SEServerExtender/SEServerExtender) Plugin for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) ðŸš€

Factions fight à¸‡ over control of the center of the map and   
are rewarded with points for capturing the center :smiling_imp:

**Motivation:**  
Space Engineers is missing a good game mode for online multiplayer PvP (Player vs Player)

Currently most players:  
1. Join a server  
2. Hermit/hide for a month  
3. Server resets  
4. Rinse, Repeat  

Nobody ever runs into each other,  
this game mode gives players a purpose, something to fight over!
