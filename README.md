# SECenterDeath
King of the Hill [SEServerExtender](https://github.com/SEServerExtender/SEServerExtender) Plugin for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) 🚀

Factions fight over control of the center of the map and   
are rewarded with points for capturing the center :smiling_imp:  
(Must be only faction within 100 meters of center for 1 minute to recieve a capture point)  

*CenterRadius* and *CaptureInterval* are both editable  

Use */leaderboard* command to see Top 10 Factions

**Motivation:**  
Space Engineers is missing a good game mode for online multiplayer PvP (Player vs Player)

Currently most players:  
1. Join a server  
2. Hermit/hide/build for a month  
3. Server resets (due to the fact that given bugs and poor optimization most servers only last a month, if that)  
4. Rinse, Repeat  

Nobody ever runs into each other,  
SECenterDeath gives players a purpose, something to fight over!
